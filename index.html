            You will find the problem sheets and model answers in the section 
            below. Use problem sheets 
            to help with your revision and provide some extra practice at solving problems. 
            The answers are provided, but make sure you don't look at them until you have 
            made an earnest attempt to arrive at an answer, and also tried every strategy 
            that you can think of to check your answer!
